SNHU Final Project for Pirate Intelligent Agent


## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  For this project, I was tasked with developing a pirate intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game. The goal of the intelligent agent is to learn through rewards and penalties to efficiently navigate the maze and locate the treasure. The provided starter code included elements like the environment setup for the maze, the GameExperience class for experience replay, the build model for a neural network model, and some initial implementation for the Q-training algorithm. My primary contribution to the code was completing the Q-training algorithm in Jupyter Notebook. This required the implementation of a deep Q-learning algorithm using TensorFlow and Keras, ensuring the pirate agent could navigate the maze to find the treasure. Throughout the development process, I adhered to industry best practices, incorporating in-line comments for code readability and maintainability.
  

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists engage in problem-solving through algorithmic thinking, designing, and implementing efficient solutions. They analyze and create algorithms to address complex issues, enabling computers to perform tasks, process data, and make decisions. Computer scientists play a crucial role in advancing technology, driving innovation, and shaping the digital landscape. Their work impacts various fields, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and education, making technology more accessible, efficient, and beneficial to society.
  

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  As a computer scientist, my approach to problem-solving involves breaking down complex issues into manageable components, designing algorithms to address each facet, and considering potential challenges and edge cases to ensure efficiency. Collaboration with peers and stakeholders allows for diverse perspectives and input, while iterative testing and debugging refine the solution for reliability. Effective communication throughout the process ensures a thorough understanding of requirements and a robust implementation that meets the desired objectives.
  

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization involve ensuring the well-being and privacy of users and maintaining the integrity of the organization. This means I need to prioritize transparency in system design and implementation, avoid biases in algorithms, and safeguard user data. It is crucial to provide clear documentation, implement robust security measures, and stay informed about emerging ethical concerns. In addition, promoting inclusivity and diversity in technology solutions and considering the societal impact of innovations are important ethical considerations. Upholding these standards fosters trust, promotes responsible technology use, and contributes positively to the digital landscape.
